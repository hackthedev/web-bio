            <h2>About me</h2>
            I'm 19 years old and my name is Marcel. I live in Austria where we speak German.
            I like to play video games, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2xF-BCo1FWYMw-gbaAOMZAVxLXW_VTiy" target="_blank">

            I really love anime. I'd recommend watching Angel Beats, Black Butler, Date A Live and a lot more! If you're one of those people who always keep
            hating anime: its totally fine. But have you every actually tried finding and watching some good anime? I bet not ;P<br><br>

            There is not a lot to say about me. Im mostly shy but im generally open to everyone. Im also not that good at social stuff and showing emotions,
            but i try my best to improve everyday!<br><br>

            If you get to know me better you will learn how to read me. If you're ever bored just text me i like to have conversations.<br><br>
